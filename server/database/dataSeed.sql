The story of her origin is as follows: A man suspected his wife of having an affair, so he followed her late one night when she thought he was asleep. Sure enough, she went to a field near their property where she met her lover. The husband was enraged and killed his wife, which resulted in a struggle with the other man. Both men died from their injuries. It is said that late at night (especially during the night of and the nights preceding a full moon) people driving by the field can see her ghost, searching for her lover. Some people have reported stopping to try to communicate with her, but she always disappears or runs into the woods where she cannot be followed (due to the thick brambles that inhabit the area). She is said to dress in a long white gown which authorities say dates her to the turn of the 20th century. Usually she is seen alone, but sometimes witnesses report seeing a ghostly death scene re-enacted... Others report seeing nothing at all but hearing the killer''s shouts of rage followed by the victims'' screams of agony...

Here is a bit of history on the place. The building had been McDowell''s College, a medical college owned and operated by Joseph Nash McDowell. It was confiscated by the Federal authorities in the spring of 1861. In December 1861 the building was converted into a prison and later renamed. Even early Federal records often call the place "McDowell''s College." It was right in the midst of some of the wealthiest homes in St. Louis. General Fremont''s headquarters in the Brant Mansion were only a block away. Right across the street was the home of the wealthy Harrison family. Attached to Gratiot on the north was the Christian Brothers Academy. Unlike other Civil War prisons, Gratiot was used to hold just about anyone and everyone. Along with Confederate prisoners of war were also held civilians ("citizens"), women, children, confiscated slaves ("contrabands"), spies, saboteurs, political prisoners, guerrillas and bushwhackers, and even Federal soldiers who had committed crimes or had misbehaved. Of Confederate soldiers held at Gratiot, the most likely ones came from battles and states in the Mississippi River region as far south as New Orleans. They were sent north for processing at Gratiot then moved on to Alton and other eastern prisons. Also soldiers fighting in Missouri and Arkansas would be sent to St. Louis.
